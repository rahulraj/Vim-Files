In this package, you will find two tools for working with JSim files in VIM:
	A) language definition for Exuberant Ctags
	B) syntax file with support for commonly used statements

INSTALLATION
	1.  Extract this archive into your .vim directory.  It will add the files:
			LICENSE
			README
			ctags-jsim
			.ftdetect/jsim.vim
			.syntax/jsim.vim
	
	2.  If you want Ctags support, perform the two operations listed in the file
	    ctags-jsim.  You also need taglist.vim, available at:
			http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=273

	3.  You may now remove this file (README) and ctags-jsim

	4.  Open a JSim file in VIM.  Some syntax (like .plot, .connect, .subckt, 
	    X*, and the ports in definitions and instantiations) should be colored.
	    If you installed Ctags support, TagList will open up and show you 
	    subcircuits, plots, and instantiations.

TODO
	- The regex for some of the syntax matching is really long and ugly (and in
	  one case, just plain ridiculous).  This might be slow for older systems. 
	  The syntax matching needs to be refined quite a bit and expanded as well 
	  to support multiline statements and more keywords.

	- It would also be nice to be able to see the difference between input and 
	  output ports.  Perhaps it would be possible to do this by asking the user
	  to use tabs between the input and output ports and match that way.

	- There are no bugs at all.  Nope.  None.
